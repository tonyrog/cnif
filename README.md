# CNIF
A standalone library that implements data part of the Erlangs nif api.

This library can be useful when handling Erlang term data
in C programs. This may be configuration files or
data files for code generations etc etc.

One practical aspect of this library is that
the C code can be used pretty straight forward in
a nif or vice verse, using nif code in a standalone
program or a port program.
